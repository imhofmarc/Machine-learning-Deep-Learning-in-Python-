# RandomForest & MLP in Python 

We are going to see how to implement a RandomForest and a MultiLayer Perceptron with data from a real estate agency.
You can find similar data there (for french people) : https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques
The goal here is to estimate the price of a property. 
We need to be the closer from the estimate price of the real estate agent.
Therefore you can tell that it will be a regression problem and not a classification problem.

There will be 4 steps : 
- Of course getting the data, go for a quick look of what we have and what does the features mean with quick analysis.
- Pre processing the data (NA's, Flag, Top etc)
- Split into training and testing dataset
- Creating our models and try to optimize it
